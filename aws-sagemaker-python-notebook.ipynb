       "<p>Josh Woodward seems to have a career death wish. A prolific indie acoustic-rock songwriter, he has released ten albums in the past eight years, but he has chosen to give away all of his music for free. In a world of $18 CDs and lawsuits against file sharing grandmothers, Josh offers 180 songs as free downloads from his websites, and sells CDs on a name-your-own-price basis.</p>\\n<p>This gamble has paid off well; he's used file sharing to build a viral, worldwide network of fans. After over three-and-a-half million MP3 downloads from his site, he's living proof that the music world is changing. His brand of energetic and passionate delivery with vivid stories, clever wordplay and dark humor may not be for everyone, but the Internet has made it possible to find its audience.</p>\\n<p>To date, he's released ten albums. His most recent, \"The Wake\", was released in August 2012. The album represents a distillation of the best of what his music has to offer: upbeat folk rockers, delicate acoustic pieces, with a touch of humor in places. VideoSongs - music videos of the entire production process - were made for each of the 13 songs. A Kickstarter campaign to fund the album ended up being overfunded by 250%. As with all of Josh's music, it's a one-man operation: written, performed, recorded and released with a do-it-yourself, guerilla mentality.</p>\\n<p>The Internet is the main source of exposure for Josh's music. With over 13,000 subscribers YouTube for the many VideoSongs and acoustic performances, and over ten thousand videos from other users feature his music, totalling over 150 million views. He was also a featured artist for Clear Channel New in Winter 2006, which included extensive online promotion and national radio airplay. He's one of the most downloaded artists on Jamendo, a Creative Commons music site, where he won the award for Best Pop Artist in 2011.

Sure, the electronic musician lays claim to producing the sweetest beats this side of the Milky Way Galaxy, but the world’s funkiest diplomat is also using his popularity to steer the millennial generation toward a nourishing and sustainable way of relating with art, community and the planet. From birthing the Permaculture Action Movement (a movement where the energy of show/festival goers is catalyzed into community action), to creating a program where nutritious beverage options are available at music venues on a routed TPA tour, the ambassador is using his clout to make real, tangible change, and along the way inspiring hundreds of thousands.</p>\\n<p>With a stack of 17 albums and countless remixes, the jumpsuited one ( that’s right…TPA rocks the freshest jumpsuit) has swirled together a cornucopia of music for your auditory senses…and your booty. Over the last decade, his sound has dipped and swirled through a staggering range of styles, each album exploring uncharted sonic territory. Warm, analogue dreamwave; mind-altering glitch; world-infused groove; bass-fueled breaks; sexified down-tempo; electric lullabies; and psy-fi funk are just a few of the genres that have poured from the Ambassador’s soul into earbuds and ghetto-blasters across the galaxy.</p>\\n<p>In the live setting, expect to be taken on a masterfully crafted and evocative journey mixing old and new into an auditory canvas that will spark nostalgia, titilate your senses, and make you drop that bottom like it was ‘92…3092. All of that music you hear? It’s all created via solar power on TPA’s off-grid community homestead AND it’s available for free or “Name Your Price.” Just one of the ways The Ambassador says “Thank You” to all of the people out there who have supported the project along the way.</p>\\n<p>So if TPA’s earth-space escalade is docking at a city or festival near you…dust off your onesie, get ready to boogie and gear up for an epic community action day. Welcome to the future, where we don’t just party. We party with a purpose.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             214\n",
       "<p>In 1998, Hip Hop visionary and Public Enemy leader Chuck D took to the fledgling world wide web to establish a fan super-site that featured a forum where PE fans and like-minded individuals could share information with one another. This ever-expanding community, known as The EnemyBoard, would not only bring people together but it would also spawn creative endeavors that no one had previous thought possible.</p>\\n<p>Utilizing the burgeoning MP3 compression technology, EnemyBoard member C-Doc (The WarHammer) theorized that since it was possible to transmit entire songs across the Internet, it would therefore be possible to send parts of songs. He explained that a producer or DJ could send a beat to an MC who could then record a vocal and send back the a capella. These experiments came first with selections from an EnemyBoard compilation album and then culminated with the birth of what would become The Impossebulls with the song We Don’t Need You.</p>\\n<p>‘We Don’t Need You’ was produced by Bill Tha Pharmacizt from California and featured Chuck, Professor Griff, Kyle Jason, and Xeno from the group DFXO giving their own scathing attack on the outdated and crooked practices of the music industry. The song was remixed by C-Doc and became quite the internet sensation, signaling the beginning of a new era in recorded music techniques. The success of ‘We Don’t Need You’ inspired Chuck to form a rhyme collective of musicians from The EnemyBoard overseen by C-Doc. Dubbed The Impossebulls, this group of talent from around the world could cut and release records at a moment’s notice on a variety of topics. Their online home became Chuck’s newly revamped SLAMJAMZ record label and the crew recorded a self-titled album in 2001.</p>\\n<p>The core members of the group began performing live and refining the squad into a more manageable entity. Marcus J Gilligan (Xenia, Ohio), Tirade (Kent, Ohio), C-Doc (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), and DJ President Ike (New York, New York) have created a dynamic live show that not only showcases the group’s music but also pays homage to Hip Hop’s forefathers. Along with Pvt Militant (Flint, Michigan) and DJ Def Chad (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), The Impossebulls opened up four shows on the 2002 Public Enemy Revolverlution Tour to rave reviews and overwhelming crowd enthusiasm. They continue to perform in support of their new album SLAVE EDUCATION, as they continue fusing hardcore beats with socially conscious lyrics, addressing the problems and concerns of people around the world.</p>\\n<p>- Mark Dowding</p>    213\n",

This is an HIV warning song with lyrics that even made Sergeant Black, the hardcore rasta security guy at the studio we asked to translate, slightly embarrased.  She's a real talent though, and raps like no other woman we met in Kenya.  The beat is produced by LaFam  Lyrics at the bandcamp page: http://rawmusicinternational.bandcamp.com/</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                1\n",
       "<p>Phillip Stearns (AKA Pixel Form) is a practitioner of sound and visual arts; music composer and performer; electronics sculptor and installation artist. He is a graduate of the California Institute of the Arts music composition department where he studied with David Rosenboom, Hans W. Koch, Michael Pisaro, Mark Trayle, Sarah Roberts, Tom Leeser, and Andy Kopra. Central to his practice are the use of custom electronics, hand-craft, hardware hacking techniques, media technologies, procedural processes, organic and natural gardening, and seed saving. He views technology as a site for exploring contemporary society, cultural tendencies, and the horizons of violence, politics, information, noise, control, proximity, parity, subversion, corruption, interconnectedness and interrelatedness. Pursuing organic and natural agricultural practices and ecological design are a way of addressing the harmful impacts of the widespread proliferation of modern technologies and mediating the damages resulting from their wanton consumption and disposal. Characteristic of his work is judicial use of materials, restraint, simplicity, a careful balance between conceptual depth and playfulness. He has presented, performed, lectured, exhibited, led workshops, and screened works at various festivals, conferences, residencies, museums and institutions around the US and Northern Europe including the Experimental TV Center, NIME, Filmer La Musique, STEIM, Darmstadt, Torrance Art Museum, Machine Project, Telic, Optica film festival, ISIM conference, GLAMFA exhibition, Spark festival, Bent festival, Soundwalk, Chaos Communications Camp, Cal Arts, SFSU, UCSD, UC Davis, and Mills College.</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "<p>I’m returning to India for a track by Master Laloo, a singer from Gujarat, presumably. Collecting Indian music has always been daunting to me - I love it, but there are so many excellent artists out there, I’m overwhelmed. That said, I enjoy what I have, and what I continue to pick up. Hell, it’s all a giant experiment, for the most part, and that’s what continues to make it fun.</p>\\n<p>While Laloo doesn’t perform some of the same vocal gymnastics as other masters of Indian classical music, there’s something very appealing to me about the combination of voice, harmonium, and tabla. Basically, what I’m trying to say is that I enjoy listening to this record, which is what it’s all about. Judging by the label and the pressing (which was made in the Gramophone Company’s Indian plant, at Dum Dum), I would guess this stems from the early to mid-1930s.</p>\\n<p>I could find nothing on the Master in question, although I am in the process of trying to obtain a title translation. If anyone else can step up to the plate, please do! However, the label is quite difficult to read due to the gold on green background.</p>\\n<p>On a side note, R. and I went to a concert of Central Asian music in Los Angeles the other night. I always feel nervous beforehand that a concert like that will be too faux world-y for me, but it was very good, and one artist stood out: the Kazakh singer and dombra player Ulzhan Baibussynova. Although she performed only three songs, they were riveting.

With their debut EP Passiflore, released last fall, these moody enchantresses cast a powerful spell on ambient-attuned ears.</span></p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       1\n",

       "<p>Joel Stern &amp; Anthony Guerra met in London in         2000 and started performing and recording         regularly as an improvising duo. Their first         works focussed mainly on densely textural drones         .         produced by the meshing of layered electric         guitar tones with processed environmental field         recordings. Although the basic working materials         have remained relatively unchanged, recent         Stern/Guerra recordings and performances have         shown an increasing attention towards minute         gestural detail framed within sparsely arranged,         slow moving passages of abstract continuity.         Stern &amp; Guerra have previously released sound on         the label twothousandand and have a track on the         Touch compilation \"Ringtones.\"</p>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            1\n",

       "<p>Born in 1983, Gaspar Claus has started the cello at age 5. From his long  studies in music Highschool with great teachers such as Philip Muller  (NMSC, Paris) he kept a part of his technical background. But his  current research is based on an exploration of his cello skills beyond  its basic use.<br /> He uses the whole body of the instrument (wood, metal &amp; horsehair)  to create a universe of sounds that he plays during his improvisations  with many artists. His desire is to preserve the listening pleasure even  in the most extreme situations. It always goes from one project to  another, from one world to another, combining his music with very  different worlds.<br /> Besides his solo performances (at the Knitting Factory, NYC; at Star  Pine Cafe, Tokyo in galleries in Paris and in festivals) he has several  projects with dancers like Nina Dipla (who worked with Pina Bausch) or  Moeno Wakamatsu (who has worked with Merce Cunningham, Masaki Iwana …),  with French actors (Anne Alvaro, Serge Pey …) with electronic musicians  (Rone, J_Mahtab, A. Yterce, Joakim from Tigersushi …), pop musicians  (Ramona Cordova, Damo Suzuki, Kria Brekkan, Scout Niblett, Sufjan  Stevens, Cali …), the flamenco guitarist Pedro Soler (they played at the  Philharmonie in Berlin, November 2007, current album planned for 2010)  with Benat Achiary (the Concertgebouw of Bruges December 2008), or with  Catherine Jauniaux, concerts with the improvised music scene in Japan  (Umezu Kazutoki, Hiromishi Sakamoto, Kazuki Tomokawa, Otomo Yoshihide,  Keiji Haino, Sachiko M…) or other very special concert as a duo with a  masseur in a German’s Christmas market in Berlin , a musical project  about Physics &amp; pets called “Schrödinger’s Cat”, duo piano &amp;  cello, whose album was released in February 2009.<br /> Constantly looking for new artistic experiences, he is now also involved  in many projects throughout the world. With the French filmmaker  Vincent Moon, travel on all continents to document the music, crossed  with the sound of his cello.
