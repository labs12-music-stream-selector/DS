       "<p>A mysterious bear named Podington took the Internet by storm in 2007, releasing three beautifully crafted songs a week. Podington's podcast rubbed shoulders with <em>KEXP's Song of the Day</em> and <em>NPR's All Songs Considered</em> atop the the iTunes charts, while his story captivated <em>Morning Edition</em>, <em>The Globe and Mail</em>, <em>Wired.com's</em> Listening Post, and and dozens of influential music blogs. The experiment inspired countless new works of art, and translated into commercial success.</p>\\n<p>The true identity of Podington Bear remained a mystery throughout the entire project. Then, upon the release of a retrospective box set in July 2008 his identity was revealed.  <strong>Chad Crouch</strong>, proprietor of Portland Oregon's influential HUSH Records, and former bandleader for the group Blanket Music was the big-eared culprit.</p>\\n<p>Since then, Crouch has continued to record instrumental music as Podington Bear, while significantly broadening his ouevre to include minimalism, neoclassical, ambient, soul, and simply more of what people were attracted to in the first place:  Music that surprises and delights, regardless of genre.</p>\\n<p>Crouch released an

       "<p>Josh Woodward seems to have a career death wish. A prolific indie acoustic-rock songwriter, he has released ten albums in the past eight years, but he has chosen to give away all of his music for free. In a world of $18 CDs and lawsuits against file sharing grandmothers, Josh offers 180 songs as free downloads from his websites, and sells CDs on a name-your-own-price basis.</p>\\n<p>This gamble has paid off well; he's used file sharing to build a viral, worldwide network of fans. After over three-and-a-half million MP3 downloads from his site, he's living proof that the music world is changing. His brand of energetic and passionate delivery with vivid stories, clever wordplay and dark humor may not be for everyone, but the Internet has made it possible to find its audience.</p>\\n<p>To date, he's released ten albums. His most recent, \"The Wake\", was released in August 2012. The album represents a distillation of the best of what his music has to offer: upbeat folk rockers, delicate acoustic pieces, with a touch of humor in places. VideoSongs - music videos of the entire production process - were made for each of the 13 songs. A Kickstarter campaign to fund the album ended up being overfunded by 250%. As with all of Josh's music, it's a one-man operation: written, performed, recorded and released with a do-it-yourself, guerilla mentality.</p>\\n<p>The Internet is the main source of exposure for Josh's music. With over 13,000 subscribers YouTube for the many VideoSongs and acoustic performances, and over ten thousand videos from other users feature his music, totalling over 150 million views. He was also a featured artist for Clear Channel New in Winter 2006, which included extensive online promotion and national radio airplay. He's one of the most downloaded artists on Jamendo, a Creative Commons music site, where he won the award for Best Pop Artist in 2011. Since 2010, \"Swansong\" has been the featured song in Ubuntu Linux.</p>

       "<p>The Polish Ambassador (real name David Sugalski) is raising the bar for what it means to be a professionally touring musician. Sure, the electronic musician lays claim to producing the sweetest beats this side of the Milky Way Galaxy, but the world’s funkiest diplomat is also using his popularity to steer the millennial generation toward a nourishing and sustainable way of relating with art, community and the planet. From birthing the Permaculture Action Movement (a movement where the energy of show/festival goers is catalyzed into community action), to creating a program where nutritious beverage options are available at music venues on a routed TPA tour, the ambassador is using his clout to make real, tangible change, and along the way inspiring hundreds of thousands.</p>\\n<p>With a stack of 17 albums and countless remixes, the jumpsuited one ( that’s right…TPA rocks the freshest jumpsuit) has swirled together a cornucopia of music for your auditory senses…and your booty. Over the last decade, his sound has dipped and swirled through a staggering range of styles, each album exploring uncharted sonic territory. Warm, analogue dreamwave; mind-altering glitch; world-infused groove; bass-fueled breaks; sexified down-tempo; electric lullabies; and psy-fi funk are just a few of the genres that have poured from the Ambassador’s soul into earbuds and ghetto-blasters across the galaxy.</p>\\n<p>In the live setting, expect to be taken on a masterfully crafted and evocative journey mixing old and new into an auditory canvas that will spark nostalgia, titilate your senses, and make you drop that bottom like it was ‘92…3092. All of that music you hear?

       "<p>In 1998, Hip Hop visionary and Public Enemy leader Chuck D took to the fledgling world wide web to establish a fan super-site that featured a forum where PE fans and like-minded individuals could share information with one another. This ever-expanding community, known as The EnemyBoard, would not only bring people together but it would also spawn creative endeavors that no one had previous thought possible.</p>\\n<p>Utilizing the burgeoning MP3 compression technology, EnemyBoard member C-Doc (The WarHammer) theorized that since it was possible to transmit entire songs across the Internet, it would therefore be possible to send parts of songs. He explained that a producer or DJ could send a beat to an MC who could then record a vocal and send back the a capella. These experiments came first with selections from an EnemyBoard compilation album and then culminated with the birth of what would become The Impossebulls with the song We Don’t Need You.</p>\\n<p>‘We Don’t Need You’ was produced by Bill Tha Pharmacizt from California and featured Chuck, Professor Griff, Kyle Jason, and Xeno from the group DFXO giving their own scathing attack on the outdated and crooked practices of the music industry. The song was remixed by C-Doc and became quite the internet sensation, signaling the beginning of a new era in recorded music techniques. The success of ‘We Don’t Need You’ inspired Chuck to form a rhyme collective of musicians from The EnemyBoard overseen by C-Doc. Dubbed The Impossebulls, this group of talent from around the world could cut and release records at a moment’s notice on a variety of topics. Their online home became Chuck’s newly revamped SLAMJAMZ record label and the crew recorded a self-titled album in 2001.</p>\\n<p>The core members of the group began performing live and refining the squad into a more manageable entity. Marcus J Gilligan (Xenia, Ohio), Tirade (Kent, Ohio), C-Doc (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), and DJ President Ike (New York, New York) have created a dynamic live show that not only showcases the group’s music but also pays homage to Hip Hop’s forefathers. Along with Pvt Militant (Flint, Michigan) and DJ Def Chad (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania), The Impossebulls opened up four shows on the 2002 Public Enemy Revolverlution Tour to rave reviews and overwhelming crowd enthusiasm. They continue to perform in support of their new album SLAVE EDUCATION, as they continue fusing hardcore beats with socially conscious lyrics, addressing the problems and concerns of people around the world.</p>\\n<p>- Mark Dowding</p>

       "<p>Billy O'Neil, Ig, Bish and Matt Lenny have been playing since 2000. Sometimes they remind me of the Foo Fighters, not in a bad way. The title track to last year's full length on <a href=\"http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2008/07/www.splitredrecords.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=product.display&amp;Product_ID=3%20-\">Split Red Records</a>. \"Fools Want Noise\" is not about noise music, but about people foolishly wanting maximum noise stimulation in the form of alcohol, tv, radio, going to the bar, yelling, that sort of noise. The group suffered injuries and setbacks due to a van accident in late 2007, but are back in action recording new material in anticipation of a fall tour.

       "<p>In previous posts, I’ve mentioned Robert Crumb’s volume of international 78rpm records titled <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Presents-Women-Singers-Robert-Crumb/dp/3036914048\">Hot Women</a>, which features female vocalists. On it, he included Part 2 of an exceptionally wild recording made somewhere in East Africa in the early 1930s. Today’s post is Part 1 of that fascinating record.</p>\\n<p>Decca Records in the United States began in 1934 (after truly beginning in England in 1929), and kept their maroon label for their international series. A large portion of the music released on that international series was from this hemisphere, but they did release some imported recordings, many of which were taken from German Odeon and Parlophone masters as the label indicates here. Most famously, American Decca found success in repressing <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich_von_Hornbostel\">Erich von Hornbostel’s</a> influential “Music of the Orient” collection, which contained some recordings from as early as the ‘teens. You can still find a complete set if you’re patient. Much more difficult to track down, however, are examples from Decca’s African series.</p>\\n<p>Unfortunately, without a trip to a vault somewhere in Europe to dig through ancient paperwork (if it exists), and without a vintage catalog which might contain more information, there’s no way to tell where this record was precisely made. It could have been Kenya, it could have been Tanzania, Rwanda/Burundi, or Zanzibar. My best possible guess, considering the strong Arabic influence in the instrumentation (oud, violin, and percussion), is that it is <em>taarab</em> music from Tanzania or Zanzibar, but that is only a guess and nothing more. Or, might the two letter matrix code - BR - stand for Burundi/Rwanda? I’ve a very similar sounding 78 that is definitively from that particular region. But, who knows.</p>\\n<p>What I do know is that this vocalist will jolt you upright and rightly so. This is a one of a kind performance - just listen to her straining near the end of the piece.</p>\\n<p>For more vintage taarab music from the region, definitely check out the beautiful CD <em>Poetry and Languid Charm</em> on <a href=\"http://www.topicrecords.co.uk/acatalog/index2.html\">Topic</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Technical Notes</strong><br /> Label: Decca (from Odeon masters)<br /> Issue

       "<p>While there’s plenty of incredible American, Cajun, and Irish-American fidders, there’s also a rich history of fiddle-based folk music from Canada. And while some diehard fans of the back-woods American fiddlers might scoff (and I, myself, first gained interest in 78s through early American country music), it’s difficult to deny a track like this, Isidore Soucy’s <em>quadrille, </em>which is similar to a square-dance, except without calls. According to one source I found, a quadrille is historically a dance representing a maiden fleeing a young man’s advances, and like much folk music, was performed at community gatherings, parties, or with family.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/obj/m2/f1/nlc002680-v6.jpg\">Isidore Soucy</a> (b. Ste-Blandine, Québec, 1899, d. Montreal, 1963) was a force in traditional Québécois folk music. His recording career began in the late 1920s as a soloist, and lasted well into the LP-era, recording often with his wife and four children as the Famille Soucy. His fiddling is not as raw as some American country fiddlers, it’s more stylish and rhythmic, and its European influence is more apparent (especially with it’s piano accompaniment, like many Irish-American fiddling records of the day) - but the virtuosity is there. This track was recorded at a very early point in his career, ca. 1927.</p>\\n<p>You can find more Soucy at the virtuous <a href=\"http://www.collectionscanada.ca/gramophone/index-e.html\">Virtual Gramophone</a> website, which has dozens of fine French-Canadian folk music tracks for download (though, not this one). I would also recommend listening to some tracks by <a href=\"http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/gramophone/m2-1049-e.html\">Joseph Allard</a>.</p>\\n<p><strong>Technical Notes<br /></strong>Label:

       "<p><em>from <a href=\"http://www.last.fm/music/Nigel%20Simmons\" target=\"_blank\">last.fm</a>:</em></p>\\n<p>Nigel Simmons was a natural musician/composer/arranger from an early age. He composed his first original sonata (violin/viola) at the age of 9.<br /><br /> By the age of 18, he had studied under Professor Lee Chin Siow at the College of Charleston and Professor Oscar Ravina, of the New York Philharmonic. <br /><br /> His remixes of game-play music for Nintendo were initially released in the U.S. and have since been commercially re-released in Japan, Taiwan and Germany.<span id=\"wikiSecondPart\"><br /><br /> His arrangements for video game music have been performed by the Tokyo Philharmonic. <br /><br /> The most recent information concerning Nigel has him continuing to compose original music, working with Dweebish (an alternative music project), and experimenting with film-making.</span></p>\\n<p><em>from the <a href=\"http://www.oddiooverplay.com\" target=\"_blank\">Oddio Overplay</a> website:</em></p>\\n<p>I'm a young composer who composes various styles of music.

       "<p>This year marks a milestone for the Chicago Underground Duo.  It is their 15th year together as a band. In celebration of this momentous occasion they have released a new record on a brand new label.  <br /><br />Age of Energy is Chad Taylor and Rob Mazurek's sixth release as Chicago Underground Duo and the eleventh release in the Chicago Underground catalog. Finding time to get back in the studio was a challenge, as Rob has been touring with his trio Starlicker, The Sao Paulo Underground and the Exploding Star Orchestra and Chad with the Marc Ribot Trio, Side A (Ken Vandermark, Havaard Wiik) and Digital Primitives. The heavenly bodies even deigned to interrupt their plans to record, raining baseball-sized hailstones down like a plague upon the sessions. And yet, the Duo persevered against the cosmos to complete the new record over 4 days in Chicago with Todd Carter (TV Pow).  <br /><br />Developed during 2009 when the duo toured the east and west coasts, most of the material on the record was recorded live with very few overdubs.   Thematically, Age of Energy is concerned with the balance between controlled and uncontrolled experiences. Computers, keyboards and drum machines pulse alongside ancient instruments like the African Mbira. ‘Winds and Sweeping Pines’ opens with Chad and Rob playing synthesizers and electronics, gradually as the piece develops, Chad switches to drums and Rob switches to cornet and they improvise over a blistering bass vamp in classic Chicago Underground Duo style. ‘It's Alright’ is a piece making extensive use of electroacoustics, starting with a drone which incorporates extreme high and low frequencies. The electronics are overdriven with results of both known and unknown nature. ‘Castle In Your Heart’ is based on a traditional Shona song from Zimbabwe and constitutes the only  acoustic composition. ‘Age of Energy’  alternates between a 21/8 and a 12/8 rhythmic cycle over a dissonant pedal point.  This track was also recorded live in the studio, without any overdubs.</p>

       "<p>working with spoken, prerecorded and generated language, maoϴ investigates the abstraction of touch as an arbiter of meaning through the use of languages he may not speak. maoϴ performances involve the use of language processed using a self-built palate controller: an oral retainer-based device which allows control data to be produced based on the touch of the tongue against the roof of the mouth, notably during speech production.</p>\\n<p>maoϴ is ryan ⊥ dunn, a media and performance artist considering the implications and manipulation of mediation and communication. he is invested in open culture, expanded field interventions and the primacy of experience as product, and redefining the roles of creativity and pedagogy as both inexorably intertwined and problematically so. he

       "<p>Here is another relic from Southeast Asia in the days before the widespread use of the electric microphone. Voice and music emerge from a deep layer of surface noise. Such is the case with these early recordings: however tweaked and lessened by me, surface noise is inevitably an integral part of the listening experience.</p>\\n<p>In particularly hot and humid areas - perhaps Siam for instance, where this recording was made ca. 1927 - recording engineers would often have to pack their wax masters in dry ice to protect them from melting. Working without electricity…sometimes recording entire orchestras who played into a large horn…carting boxes of heavy equipment and hundreds of wax masters from place to place, perhaps country to country, for sometimes months at a time…the odds seemed against these expeditions. Yet many hundreds of thousands of records, perhaps even several million, were recorded all over the world before the microphone started appearing in recording studios in the mid-1920s.</p>\\n<p>Recording minutiae: originally, this selection was recorded by the <a href=\"http://excavatedshellac.wordpress.com/category/vietnam/\">Beka</a> record label, and then released by Parlophon. Beka and Parlophon were German companies, owned by the larger entity Carl Lindstrom A.G., which was purchased by the British company Columbia in 1926. The smaller German companies under the Lindstrom banner operated independently of their British owners for several years, until Columbia/Lindstrom eventually fell under the banner of EMI, and Parlophon became known as Parlophon<em>e</em>.</p>\\n<p>This is an example of Thai classical music, featuring a singer (Seeranii) and a small “phin-phaat” ensemble (also transliterated as “pii-phaat”), where a dominant instrument is the traditional Thai xylophone (the <em>rānāt</em>). You can also distinguish at least one Thai flute (the <em>khlui</em>), and in the distance (I think!), the classical Thai reed instrument, the <em>pī nai</em>. Thai classical music was originally developed as court music, and many of the instruments used date back 700+ years. The title of the piece translates to “Golden Star.”</p>\\n<p>Many thanks to Philip Yampolsky for discographical insight, and to Pluethipol Prachumphol of the Antique Phonograph and Gramophone Thai Society for help with the translation.

As Bluebrain, these brothers have brought an unrivaled energy and innovation to site-specific sound experiments, <span class=\"full_txt\">interactive concerts, and, recently, documentary film scoring. The band also opened for the newly reunited Dismemberment Plan in January 2011.<br /><br />Bluebrain released a limited edition 7\" on Sockets Records in Spring 2011. The single, entitled \"The Pull / The Push\", features lush electronic production with some of the danciest beats from the brothers to date. Also, one very special aspect of the 7\" is how the two tracks can be combined. Each side of the 7\" can be considered a stand alone track or Side A and Side B can be played simulataneously to form one song. </span></span></p>

The 21-year-old has spent the better part of his days living amidst “pleasant” and “unremarkable” in the suburbs of the San Fernando Valley, so perhaps it’s due to a general lack of local inspiration that Wiesenfeld’s own work has never fit into a prefab box of its own. Over the last six years, under the handle of [Post-Foetus], Wiesenfeld has gainfully explored the intersections and outer reaches of both electronic and acoustic music. With Baths, his eclecticism finds its greatest focus yet, in a hail of lush melodies, ghostly choirs, playful instrumentation and stuttering beats.</span></p>

       "<p>Evolutionary Jass Band began in 2001 as 'The Michigan Avenue Social Orchestra', a group created to fulfill the needs of a dance performance called 'The Whipping Hand'. Thanks to Margery Fairchild and Elizabeth Ward who choreographed the piece; if it weren't for them we might have not pursued this music. After the performance, Drummer Michael Henrickson, saxophonist Heather Vergotis and saxophonist Jef Brown decided to keep playing together under the name \"The Steele Street Revolutionary Jass Band\". After a spell was lifted, the name was simplified as we aren't trying to force anything anymore, so out went the R and we started to evolve naturally. Over time, people have joined and moved on, John Vassallo of Hochenkeit played bass for a while, Keelin Mayer of Djin Teeth (Fangs!) played sax for a spell as well. It eventually evolved into the current lineup around 2005. Every member has and continues to bring new surprises to the table, we never know what we'll sound like in six months and still don't know what we are capable of! What started out as our own version of classical and torch music has moved into what we feel and what we experiece day to day. Our first release, 'Change of Scene', was recorded in two days, the bulk of it one one hot day in August '05 with one track, Aunt Dot recorded in March '05. Look for three releases in 2008, 'This is What is Happening Today' on Community Library, Pops! and Freakout with the EJB . All records were recorded live in one or two sessions each as we like the spontaneous nature of what we do, and like to give the World our music, honest, raw and unrefined.....</p>

In no time at all, they were snapped up by Laurel  Records, released their first, and only single ('God Bless The Radio').
