I listened to the Admiral in command of the fleet as he gave a speech before the fight we were to take to the British Navy in response to their blockade that cut the port off from the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nAs the Admiral spoke of victory and courage, others cheered and drew swords high and proud in response to his calls to action. Glory, honor, spirit, freedom, and exploration.\r\n\r\n""For today the British do not understand why we do not break. For they are afraid, for they are afraid of us. Afraid of our will, afraid of our conviction, and afraid of our spirit that shines like a light on the shore to guide our ways. Today we free ourselves and this town from the grips of tyranny, once and for all. For today, we sail once more, to defend and preserve the open seas that we have the right to call free travel through without oppression or intimidation.""\r\n\r\nThe Admiral continued with more words which made the army of sailors gathered there cheer loudly, their echo resounded through the entire town as the townsfolk who were joining the fight to free the port cheered as well, with some shooting rifles off.\r\n\r\nAs the Admiral dismissed everyone and we boarded our ships and the captains gave a briefing, we all felt the sense of victory within us. To win back our freedom from the British Empire, and to tear down the walls they built around the tiny port town that desperately needed supplies and sailors who wanted to leave.\r\n\r\nWe got underway as the large battleship that belonged to the Admiral moved ahead, and blew its horn in challenge to the British, as 40 other ships joined in and soon a resounding chorus was echoed out to sea as the British remained silent on the horizon, waiting as the fleet moved into position and sailed out to meet their enemy.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the boat only said a few words as we sailed while the crew was preparing for war. ""May He forgive what we are about to do, and may we reach victory today or die trying. May the hearts and minds of this fleet and crew be like forged steel, as we carry out a heavy burden to ensure our freedom.

Because if you look up the full story it is included, but on BTS Wiki it isn't mentioned. It is also not mentioned in the Spring Day MV description."", 'Fantastic video! Very interesting and it certainly put a few things of which i was already 100% certain of its meaning in another perspective, such as the reference to the snowpiercer. Considering the snowpiercer is driving around aimlessly in a post-apocalyptic world, i would think it means that life has become baren and ugly since they lost the person. Their world has lost its life and they are just living on auto-pilot until they can be reunited. This was my initial interpretation.\n\nUsing the sea as a symbol of the collective unconcious to lament and mourn this national loss was a very powerful remark as well, it really struck a chord.\n\nAs far a music videos go, BTS have always had a sense of mystery about them and it really encouraged this culture of creating theories, working out these fictional universes, etc but Spring Day has always been the one that got away in terms of cracking the proverbial code. Every other fan-made theory has been confirmed or debunked one way or another and I believe that BTS\' silence on this particular music video is the biggest confirmation there can be concerning the Sewol meaning.\n\nThank you so much for this video, i have an incredible appreciation for people who deep-dive into things like this.\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that the whole ""defying the status quo of a government that doesnt care about us""-thing COMPLETELY went over my head until I saw this video.\nI had never seen the theory video you are referencing throughout your own but I certainly will watch it now.\n\nI would also like to mention that a short while before they released Spring Day, BTS had made considerable donations to the Sewol foundations.\n\nLastly, im very grateful how you referenced your personal life and struggles in this video. I think it adds a lot of value and genuineness. Doing that cant be easy so i think i should at least commend you for that.\n\nAnother EDIT: scrolling through the comments made me remember to say something about the lyrics: the general theme is ""missing someone"". I dont know whether you researched the lyrics or not but i thought it has some value to mention it. Its not a specific type of missing or about a specific type of relationsship, though the rap parts do have some very personal references, but the overal theme is that longing and expressing missing someone. That lament of ""when when when, please wait a little longer, we\'ll get there someday, when the tides are turning and when the flowers bloom"".\n\nThere is a reason this song has been charting in korea since its release 3 years ago.', 'thank you for this', 'Thank you I loved this. I want to watch more of your videos but I usually have trouble watching anything on YouTube that is longer than 30 minutes.', ""The queen spring day!! \nShe always gives me chills listening to her\nIt's beautiful"", 'one of my favorite songs! I remember crying when the music video was released it\'s a song that really speaks to your soul I thought it was so beautiful specially the line ""you know it all you\'re my best friend"". They really represented so well the emotion of missing someone but also feeling left out. After reading the short story ""the ones who walk away from Omelas"" I thought they did a great job using the  story to express their own story. I also appreciate how every person relates to the song in a different way.', 'Great Analysis, just some more to add this song was from the repackage of the WINGS album, the album before the love yourself series and After the most beautiful moments in life series(HYYH). In HYYH the songs revolved around desperation and wanting to be with a person but in the WINGS series it revolves around how to use that relationship in a more healthy way (How the other person can be their ""wings"" instead of dragging them down.) This is from the wings repackage (which basically means they sell the album again but with a few new songs). Based on that the lyrics of this song is after they have finally accepted their close one as their wings and that person has left them. Rather than that action of the other person leaving being perceived as bad like it was in the previous album and them wanting badly and desperately for that person to return, the lyrics treat longing in a more sentimental way showing that they have developed as a person since the last relationship ""we will meet again when the flower petals bloom"" ""when will winter be over so spring will bloom again"" Just wanted to add this interpretation. Yes the song is  also dedicated to the ferry incident, but the lyrics are very much bts\'s story of the growth that they develop through each album. The visuals also represent the lyrics with them bonding together and remembering past memories when they were together. (the group represents the relationship in the lyrics). So yes the song is both BTS storyline and a Memorial to the ferry incident at the same time.', ""BTS dies their hair all the time.  I don't think it has anything to do with maturity.  it has to do with the concept developed by them with their company.  For example, in the MV Boy With Luv, they purposely emphasized the anima with their softer appearance and rosy colors.  When they appeared on SNL, they also wore black.  I think they dress for the importance of the event. The BBMAs were a milestone this year because, for the first time internationally, they were recognized for their work and not just their fandom.
